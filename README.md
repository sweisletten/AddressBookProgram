#AddressBookProgram

Hello, I am a beginner programmer and Python is my first language. Any comments or advice would gladly be accepted.

For this project I wanted to practice creating classes and functions. After researching other python address book programs I decided to use the Pickle library and OS.
My goal is to create a program that can add new contacts, modify existing contacts, and find any contact using a name.

#HOW TO USE:

All you need is a file named "Contacts.txt" in the same directory as the main.py
